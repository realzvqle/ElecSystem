# Elec System

I woke up and was bored, so i created this weird system (someone already did this probably) for connections between two "elecs" (idk too dude) which syncs the value of the elecs themselves by incrementing it with the strength of the connection between two elecs (you can compile and mess with the Strength Adder Cli)

i was bored dude
